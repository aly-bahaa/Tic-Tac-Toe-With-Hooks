# Tic-Tac-Toe using Hooks
This is my personal implementation of [React Docs Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)

## I also implemented some of the extra tasks :
* For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button
* Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
* When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).

## Usage: 
In the project directory, you can run:
```console
npm i
```
### 
Then
```console
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
